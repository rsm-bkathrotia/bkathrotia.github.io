        "    *   **Attributes**: 6 seats, 2ft cargo, Gas engine, priced at $30.\n",
        "    *   **Interpretation**: This option has the highest market share, which suggests that a lower price combined with the base features (6 seats, Gas engine) is highly attractive to consumers. The absence of additional features seems to be offset by the lower price.\n",
        "2.  **Minivan C (22.76%)**:\n",
        "    \n",
        "    *   **Attributes**: 8 seats, 2ft cargo, Gas engine, also priced at $30.\n",
        "    *   **Interpretation**: The second most popular option, indicating a strong preference for more seating capacity at no additional cost in price, suggesting that consumers value additional seating when all other factors are equal.\n",
        "3.  **Minivan A (20.42%)**:\n",
        "    \n",
        "    *   **Attributes**: 7 seats, 2ft cargo, Hybrid engine, priced at $30.\n",
        "    *   **Interpretation**: The presence of a Hybrid engine with moderate pricing and seat count shows significant consumer interest in more environmentally friendly options when they are not priced higher than gas models.\n",
        "4.  **Minivan E (13.21%)**:\n",
        "    \n",
        "    *   **Attributes**: 6 seats, 2ft cargo, Electric engine, priced at $40.\n",
        "    *   **Interpretation**: Indicates a moderate interest in electric vehicles, though the higher price seems to be a deterrent compared to cheaper gas options.\n",
        "5.  **Minivan F (11.77%)**:\n",
        "    \n",
        "    *   **Attributes**: 7 seats, 2ft cargo, Hybrid engine, priced at $35.\n",
        "    *   **Interpretation**: Similar to Minivan A but slightly more expensive, which slightly reduces its attractiveness despite the hybrid engine.\n",
        "6.  **Minivan D (5.45%)**:\n",
        "    \n",
        "    *   **Attributes**: 7 seats, 3ft cargo, Gas engine, priced at $40.\n",
        "    *   **Interpretation**: Despite offering more cargo space, its higher price significantly lowers its market share. This suggests that price sensitivity may outweigh the benefit of additional cargo space for many consumers.\n",

        "### Overall Insights\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Price Sensitivity**: Price plays a crucial role in consumer choices, as seen by the higher market shares of the lower-priced models.\n",
        "*   **Preference for Seat Capacity**: There is a clear preference for higher seating capacity when the price is held constant.\n",
        "*   **Eco-friendly Options**: Consumers show interest in hybrid and electric vehicles, but their choices are sensitive to price differences.\n",
        "*   **Cargo Space Value**: Additional cargo space does not seem to drive higher market share, especially when accompanied by a higher price.\n",
