Estimating Yogurt Preferences\n\n### Likelihood for the Multi-nomial Logit (MNL) Model\n\nSuppose we have $i=1,\\ldots,n$ consumers who each select exactly one product $j$ from a set of $J$ products. The outcome variable is the identity of the product chosen $y_i \\in \\{1, \\ldots, J\\}$ or equivalently a vector of $J-1$ zeros and $1$ one, where the $1$ indicates the selected product. For example, if the third product was chosen out of 4 products, then either $y=3$ or $y=(0,0,1,0)$ depending on how we want to represent it. Suppose also that we have a vector of data on each product $x_j$ (eg, size, price, etc.). \n\nWe model the consumer's decision as the selection of the product that provides the most utility, and we'll specify the utility function as a linear function of the product characteristics:\n\n$$ U_{ij} = x_j'\\beta + \\epsilon_{ij} $$\n\nwhere $\\epsilon_{ij}$ is an i.i.d. extreme value error term. \n\nThe choice of the i.i.d. extreme value error term leads to a closed-form expression for the probability that consumer $i$ chooses product $j$:\n\n$$ \\mathbb{P}_i(j) = \\frac{e^{x_j'\\beta}}{\\sum_{k=1}^Je^{x_k'\\beta}} $$\n\nFor example, if there are 4 products, the probability that consumer $i$ chooses product 3 is:\n\n$$ \\mathbb{P}_i(3) = \\frac{e^{x_3'\\beta}}{e^{x_1'\\beta} + e^{x_2'\\beta} + e^{x_3'\\beta} + e^{x_4'\\beta}} $$\n\nA clever way to write the individual likelihood function for consumer $i$ is the product of the $J$ probabilities, each raised to the power of an indicator variable ($\\delta_{ij}$) that indicates the chosen product:\n\n$$ L_i(\\beta) = \\prod_{j=1}^J \\mathbb{P}_i(j)^{\\delta_{ij}} = \\mathbb{P}_i(1)^{\\delta_{i1}} \\times \\ldots \\times \\mathbb{P}_i(J)^{\\delta_{iJ}}$$\n\nNotice that if the consumer selected product $j=3$, then $\\delta_{i3}=1$ while $\\delta_{i1}=\\delta_{i2}=\\delta_{i4}=0$ and the likelihood is:\n\n$$ L_i(\\beta) = \\mathbb{P}_i(1)^0 \\times \\mathbb{P}_i(2)^0 \\times \\mathbb{P}_i(3)^1 \\times \\mathbb{P}_i(4)^0 = \\mathbb{P}_i(3) = \\frac{e^{x_3'\\beta}}{\\sum_{k=1}^Je^{x_k'\\beta}} $$\n\nThe joint likelihood (across all consumers) is the product of the $n$ individual likelihoods:\n\n$$ L_n(\\beta) = \\prod_{i=1}^n L_i(\\beta) = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\prod_{j=1}^J \\mathbb{P}_i(j)^{\\delta_{ij}} $$\n\nAnd the joint log-likelihood function is:\n\n$$ \\ell_n(\\beta) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^J \\delta_{ij} \\log(\\mathbb{P}_i(j)) $$\n\n\n### Yogurt Dataset\n\nWe will use the `yogurt_data` dataset, which provides anonymized consumer identifiers (`id`), a vector indicating the chosen product (`y1`:`y4`), a vector indicating if any products were \"featured\" in the store as a form of advertising (`f1`:`f4`), and the products' prices (`p1`:`p4`). For example, consumer 1 purchased yogurt 4 at a price of 0.079/oz and none of the yogurts were featured/advertised at the time of consumer 1's purchase.  Consumers 2 through 7 each bought yogurt 2, etc.\n\n_todo: import the data, maybe show the first few rows, and describe the data a bit._\n\n\n\n::: {#99949691 .cell message='true' execution_count=2}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=2}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>id</th>\n      <th>y1</th>\n      <th>y2</th>\n      <th>y3</th>\n      <th>y4</th>\n      <th>f1</th>\n      <th>f2</th>\n      <th>f3</th>\n      <th>f4</th>\n      <th>p1</th>\n      <th>p2</th>\n      <th>p3</th>\n      <th>p4</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0.108</td>\n      <td>0.081</td>\n      <td>0.061</td>\n      <td>0.079</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0.108</td>\n      <td>0.098</td>\n      <td>0.064</td>\n      <td>0.075</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0.108</td>\n      <td>0.098</td>\n      <td>0.061</td>\n      <td>0.086</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>4</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0.108</td>\n      <td>0.098</td>\n      <td>0.061</td>\n      <td>0.086</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0.125</td>\n      <td>0.098</td>\n      <td>0.049</td>\n      <td>0.079</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>...</th>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2425</th>\n      <td>2426</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0.122</td>\n      <td>0.086</td>\n      <td>0.061</td>\n      <td>0.086</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2426</th>\n      <td>2427</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0.122</td>\n      <td>0.086</td>\n      <td>0.061</td>\n      <td>0.086</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2427</th>\n      <td>2428</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0.122</td>\n      <td>0.086</td>\n      <td>0.061</td>\n      <td>0.086</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2428</th>\n      <td>2429</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0.122</td>\n      <td>0.086</td>\n      <td>0.050</td>\n      <td>0.086</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2429</th>\n      <td>2430</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0.108</td>\n      <td>0.086</td>\n      <td>0.043</td>\n      <td>0.079</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>2430 rows × 13 columns</p>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe dataset contains the following columns:\n\n*   `id`: Unique identifier for each consumer.\n*   `y1` to `y4`: Binary indicators showing which of the four yogurts was chosen by the consumer. Only one of these columns will have a value of `1` per row, indicating the chosen product.\n*   `f1` to `f4`: Binary indicators showing whether each of the four yogurts was featured (advertised) in the store at the time of the purchase.\n*   `p1` to `p4`: Numeric values representing the price per ounce of each of the four yogurts.\n\nFrom the preview of the data:\n\n*   In the first row, consumer with `id` 1 purchased yogurt 4 (as indicated by `y4` = 1) at a price of 0.079 per ounce. None of the yogurts were featured.\n*   Subsequent rows show similar data for other consumers, indicating their choices and the conditions (price and whether the product was featured) under each product.\n\n\nLet the vector of product features include brand dummy variables for yogurts 1-3 (we'll omit a dummy for product 4 to avoid multi-collinearity), a dummy variable to indicate if a yogurt was featured, and a continuous variable for the yogurts' prices:  \n\n$$ x_j' = [\\mathbbm{1}(\\text{Yogurt 1}), \\mathbbm{1}(\\text{Yogurt 2}), \\mathbbm{1}(\\text{Yogurt 3}), X_f, X_p] $$\n\nThe \"hard part\" of the MNL likelihood function is organizing the data, as we need to keep track of 3 dimensions (consumer $i$, covariate $k$, and product $j$) instead of the typical 2 dimensions for cross-sectional regression models (consumer $i$ and covariate $k$). \n\nWhat we would like to do is reorganize the data from a \"wide\" shape with $n$ rows and multiple columns for each covariate, to a \"long\" shape with $n \\times J$ rows and a single column for each covariate.  As part of this re-organization, we'll add binary variables to indicate the first 3 products; the variables for featured and price are included in the dataset and simply need to be \"pivoted\" or \"melted\" from wide to long.  \n\n_todo: reshape and prep the data_\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#e0108313 .cell message='true' execution_count=5}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=5}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>id</th>\n      <th>choice</th>\n      <th>featured</th>\n      <th>price</th>\n      <th>product</th>\n      <th>brand1</th>\n      <th>brand2</th>\n      <th>brand3</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0.108</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0.108</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0.108</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>4</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0.108</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0.125</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe dataset has been reshaped into the long format using the dataset named \"yogurt\".

Here’s how to interpret the intercepts:\n\n1.  **Beta for Brand 1 (`beta_1`)**: 1.388\n    \n    *   This positive intercept suggests that, holding other factors constant (such as price and whether the product was featured), Brand 1 is preferred over Brand 4. The higher positive value indicates a strong preference for this brand.\n2.  **Beta for Brand 2 (`beta_2`)**: 0.644\n    \n    *   Similarly, this positive intercept indicates a preference for Brand 2 over Brand 4, though the preference is less strong compared to Brand 1. Brand 2 is still preferred but not as much as Brand 1.\n3.  **Beta for Brand 3 (`beta_3`)**: −3.086\n    \n    *   The negative value of this intercept indicates that Brand 3 is less preferred compared to Brand 4. This substantial negative value suggests a strong aversion to Brand 3 relative to the other options.\n\n### Which yogurt is most preferred?\n\nBased on the magnitude and direction of the beta coefficients:\n\n*   **Brand 1** is the most preferred yogurt among the options. It has the highest positive intercept, indicating the strongest preference relative to the baseline (Brand 4).\n*   **Brand 2** is also preferred over the baseline but to a lesser extent than Brand 1.\n*   **Brand 3** is the least preferred, with a significant negative intercept indicating a strong preference against it compared to Brand 4.\n\nThis interpretation can help in strategic decisions related to marketing and product placement, such as focusing promotional efforts on Brands 1 and 2, considering price adjustments or rebranding for Brand 3, and understanding the competitive position of Brand 4 as a potentially neutral or fallback option.\n\n\n_todo: use the estimated price coefficient as a dollar-per-util conversion factor. Use this conversion factor to calculate the dollar benefit between the most-preferred yogurt (the one with the highest intercept) and the least preferred yogurt (the one with the lowest intercept). This is a per-unit monetary measure of brand value._\n\n*   **Identify the most and least preferred yogurts**:\n    \n    *   Most preferred: Brand 1 (intercept = 1.388)\n    *   Least preferred: Brand 3 (intercept = -3.086)\n*   **Calculate the difference in utilities** between the most preferred and least preferred yogurts:\n    \n*   **Use the price coefficient as a conversion factor**:\n    \n    *   Price coefficient (`beta_p`): −37.058\n    *   The price coefficient's magnitude indicates the decrease in the utility of purchasing a yogurt per dollar increase in its price. Therefore, it acts as a conversion factor from utility to dollar value.\n\n\n\n::: {#4472174b .cell message='true' execution_count=10}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Calculate the dollar benefit\ndollar_benefit = utility_difference * dollar_value_per_util\ndollar_benefit\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=10}\n```\n-0.12072966700847321\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe calculated dollar benefit between the most preferred yogurt (Brand 1) and the least preferred yogurt (Brand 3) is approximately \\-$0.121 per unit. This indicates that consumers might be willing to pay about 12 cents more per unit for Brand 1 over Brand 3 due to their difference in utility, based on the model estimates.\n\nThis negative sign might initially seem counterintuitive, but it reflects how much less consumers would be willing to pay for the less preferred option (Brand 3). In other words, Brand 1 has a higher inherent value of about 12 cents per unit over Brand 3 in the eyes of consumers.\n\nThis monetary measure effectively quantifies the brand value in dollar terms based on consumer preferences modeled by the MNL. This insight can be leveraged for pricing strategies and marketing efforts to enhance product positioning and profitability.\n\nOne benefit of the MNL model is that we can simulate counterfactuals (eg, what if the price of yogurt 1 was $0.10/oz instead of $0.08/oz).\n\n_todo: calculate the market shares in the market at the time the data were collected.

This significant reduction clearly indicates that the price sensitivity for Yogurt 1 is quite high, and even a modest price increase leads to a substantial shift in consumer preferences away from this product.\n*   **Shifts to Other Products**: The market shares of Yogurt 2, 3, and 4 all increase.

This suggests that consumers consider Yogurt 2 a close substitute for Yogurt 1, switching to it when Yogurt 1 becomes more expensive.\n*   **Yogurt 3 and 4**: Even though Yogurt 3 had a very low initial market share, it sees a relative increase, suggesting some consumers might switch to lower preference options if their first choice becomes less economically viable. Yogurt 4 also sees a notable increase in market share.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe $0.10 price increase for Yogurt 1 drastically reduces its market share, confirming the price sensitivity and showing a clear preference shift among consumers to other available options, particularly Yogurt 2. This demonstrates the importance of pricing strategies in competitive markets and highlights the value of using such models for predictive analytics in marketing and pricing decisions.\n\n\n## 2.

Which features are more preferred?_\n\n*   **Price**: The negative coefficient for price (−0.1486) indicates that as the price increases, the likelihood of choosing that option decreases, as expected.\n*   **Seat 7 and Seat 8**: Both coefficients are negative, indicating less preference compared to the baseline (6 seats). The magnitude of the coefficient for Seat 7 is larger, suggesting a stronger negative preference compared to Seat 8.\n*   **Cargo 3**: The positive coefficient (0.4099) suggests a preference for more cargo space (3ft) over the baseline (2ft).\n*   **Eng Hyb**: The slight negative coefficient for the hybrid engine (−0.1102) suggests a slight aversion compared to the gasoline engine, although this effect is relatively small.\n\nThese coefficients provide insights into the preferences of respondents regarding different features of the products presented in the conjoint study. The standard errors indicate the precision of these estimates, with all p-values being significant, showing strong evidence against the null hypothesis of no effect.\n\n\n_todo: Use the price coefficient as a dollar-per-util conversion factor.

This calculation converts the utility gained from larger cargo space into a monetary equivalent using the sensitivity of consumer choices to changes in price.\n\n\n_todo: assume the market consists of the following 6 minivans.

The absence of additional features seems to be offset by the lower price.\n2.  **Minivan C (22.76%)**:\n    \n    *   **Attributes**: 8 seats, 2ft cargo, Gas engine, also priced at $30.\n    *   **Interpretation**: The second most popular option, indicating a strong preference for more seating capacity at no additional cost in price, suggesting that consumers value additional seating when all other factors are equal.\n3.  **Minivan A (20.42%)**:\n    \n    *   **Attributes**: 7 seats, 2ft cargo, Hybrid engine, priced at $30.\n    *   **Interpretation**: The presence of a Hybrid engine with moderate pricing and seat count shows significant consumer interest in more environmentally friendly options when they are not priced higher than gas models.\n4.  **Minivan E (13.21%)**:\n    \n    *   **Attributes**: 6 seats, 2ft cargo, Electric engine, priced at $40.\n    *   **Interpretation**: Indicates a moderate interest in electric vehicles, though the higher price seems to be a deterrent compared to cheaper gas options.\n5.  **Minivan F (11.77%)**:\n    \n    *   **Attributes**: 7 seats, 2ft cargo, Hybrid engine, priced at $35.\n    *   **Interpretation**: Similar to Minivan A but slightly more expensive, which slightly reduces its attractiveness despite the hybrid engine.\n6.  **Minivan D (5.45%)**:\n    \n    *   **Attributes**: 7 seats, 3ft cargo, Gas engine, priced at $40.\n    *   **Interpretation**: Despite offering more cargo space, its higher price significantly lowers its market share. This suggests that price sensitivity may outweigh the benefit of additional cargo space for many consumers.\n\n### Overall Insights\n\n*   **Price Sensitivity**: Price plays a crucial role in consumer choices, as seen by the higher market shares of the lower-priced models.\n*   **Preference for Seat Capacity**: There is a clear preference for higher seating capacity when the price is held constant.\n*   **Eco-friendly Options**: Consumers show interest in hybrid and electric vehicles, but their choices are sensitive to price differences.\n*   **Cargo Space Value**: Additional cargo space does not seem to drive higher market share, especially when accompanied by a higher price.\n\nThese insights could be used to strategize product offerings, pricing decisions, and marketing campaigns by highlighting features that align with consumer preferences.\n\n\n_hint: this example is taken from the \"R 4 Marketing Research\" book by Chapman and Feit.
